How to take advantage of Networking to boost me as an independent professional?

In my 5 years of experience in the management of social networks and the generation of content, Networking has been of great help, and it is not by chance that it is the aptitude with more validations in my Linkedin profile, so I have decided to dedicate a post to this topic, where I speak from my experience, which can be of help for those who want to get more out of it.

1. Tips for newbies: how to start networking

Patience, there are no shortcuts or magic formulas here.
Sponges: learn from your experience and that of others, remember that phrase that says that intelligent is one who learns from his own mistakes and, wise, he learns from the mistakes of others.
Talk to everyone, the third-party point of view can help you notice things that you just can not do.
Investigate more, ask less: Find the information for yourself and do not expect others to do it for you.
It gives points of view without falling into controversy, because the one that falls into controversy is because it has nothing valuable to contribute.
Avoid misplaced comments, consistency always.
Take advantage of the low profile to experiment.
Do not be afraid to enter, influence is a matter of experience, not of age.
Learn from mistakes.
Complement your Social Networks with a blog where you have a more professional tone. However, take advantage and use how much network or tool there is, so you will be more clear that you like / work more, regardless of what is "fashionable".
Study the environment, analyze both the professionals of the area as companies or clients with whom you would like or not work depending on what they do or offer.
You can be broad in topics.
Do not forget the law of 6 degrees of separation (which are now 3): that you follow today can be a friend or who you interview in the future.
Your best ally in this stage: Identify sources, contacts, trends.

The enemy: Stay on the surface

What absurd things have I seen at the initial level of Networking?

Users who one day say they want to be a Community Manager and after 3 days hate social networks, then ask (or complain) why they do not hire them.

2. Tips for those who already have some experience in Networking

More patience, the road is long
Do not underestimate: the experience of others can be useful regardless of your time as a user.
Talk more about your experience and less quote experts
Talk to everyone
Avoid monologues, interact
More coherence, remember that you own what is silent and slave of what is said.
Are you wrong? It does not matter, talk about that too.
Contrast what has served you with what you have not, talk about it freely
Beware of what you offer or how you "sell", social networks change every time and what you knew yesterday may be obsolete today, such as Facebook Ads.
If your experience with the blog has been satisfactory, seek to collaborate on other blogs. If you feel that you still have to develop your writing skills, continue with yours.

What absurd things have I seen at this level?

Those who predict that this or that social network is a success or a failure based on banal things such as: if your circle of close friends uses a certain network or not.

At this level, it is necessary to be more careful with light opinions on sensitive issues.
More patient still.
Choose alliances and collaborating sites very well
Generate discussions with other experts in your area and allow participation taking into account the comments of your followers.
